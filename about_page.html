<h2>About</h2>

<div id="post">

<p>Hello! My name is Alex Arroyo. I’m 22 years old and a recent graduate of UC Berkeley. 
I received a B.A. in History and a B.S. in Conservation and Resource Studies. My passion for agriculture and ecology developed throughout my undergraduate career. I was able to take courses covering subjects from agroecology and alternative agricultural methods to wildlife biology, conservation, political ecology, and U.S. and Latin American history. My education exposed me to the countless ways in which humans engage with the natural environment, and each other, and the ways in which those systems can be made more sustainable. 
</p>
<p>
To supplement my academic study of alternative agriculture, I spent a summer working as an intern on a small-scale organic farm in Italy. I gained experience planting and harvesting organic produce for sale at local markets, preparation and preservation of foods, and care for small farm animals. The farm owners – Wanessa and Alessandro, and their son Ian – provided a nurturing atmosphere built around the hard work of running the farm. My time on the Il Cuore Verde (the “Green Heart”) farm was an opportunity to see the real-world application of principles of alternative agriculture and revealed the human side to the principles of sustainability.
</p>
<p>
I am deeply committed to farming with principles of sustainable systems. My future goals include creating a permaculture homestead; spread design strategies through teaching and application; and advocating for alternative agricultural policies and their adoption and integration on a larger social scale I feel a deep caring for the planet and believe I have an obligation to apply myself towards its preservation and restoration. I’m also very interested in the ways that alternative methods of cultivation and planning, as well as community extension, can influence broader positive social change. 
</p>
<p>
There is a profound need for ecological thinking throughout all aspects of our society and it is essential for everyone to integrate ecological understanding with political, social, and economic priorities. I feel a deep caring for the planet and believe I have an obligation to apply myself towards its preservation and restoration. I hope to gain knowledge and experience that will help me deconstruct the concept that human society is separate and superior to nature and confront the human tendency to assert ourselves over and against nature in a way that cuts us off from the sources of nourishment and inspiration that can flow into us from the web of life. I hope this site will be a space for sharing ideas and experiences and learning about sustainable food systems!
